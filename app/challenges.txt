challeges faced during the dev was

1.uniquely storing the user data and scrapping the url which user provide and embedding them 
2.reusing the scrapped content if the that url is been scrapped and stored before.
Reuse the vector DB if it already exists
Use persistent storage for the vector store (like with Chroma)

this is how i tackle this problem

data/
├── vectorstores/
│   ├── user1/
│   └── user2/
├── temp/
│   └── temporary text files for embedding
